# U.S. traffic fatalities: 1980-2004

In this lab, you are asked to answer the question **"Do changes in traffic laws affect traffic fatalities?"**  To do so, you will conduct the tasks specified below using the data set *driving.Rdata*, which includes 25 years of data that cover changes in various state drunk driving, seat belt, and speed limit laws. 

Specifically, this data set contains data for the 48 continental U.S. states from 1980 through 2004. Various driving laws are indicated in the data set, such as the alcohol level at which drivers are considered legally intoxicated. There are also indicators for “per se” laws—where licenses can be revoked without a trial—and seat belt laws. A few economics and demographic variables are also included. The description of the each of the variables in the dataset is come with the dataste.

```{r common, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(foreign) 
library(gplots) 
library(ggplot2) 
library(dplyr) 
library(corrplot) 
library(lattice) 
library(plm)
library(viridis)
library(tsibble)
library(forecast)
library(tidyverse)  
library(gridExtra)
```


**Exercises:**

1. (30%) Load the data. Provide a description of the basic structure of the dataset, as we have done throughout the semester. Conduct a very thorough EDA, which should include both graphical and tabular techniques, on the dataset, including both the dependent variable *totfatrte* and the potential explanatory variables. You need to write a detailed narrative of your observations of your EDA. *Reminder: giving an "output dump" (i.e. providing a bunch of graphs and tables without description and hoping your audience will interpret them) will receive a zero in this exercise.*

```{r 1 load, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#load data
load('driving.RData');driving.df <- data

#check rows and columns
dim(driving.df)

#check for gaps in panel
table(data$state)
table(data$year)
```
The Dataset is panel data, that contains observations about different US states from year 1980 to 2004. There are 1200 observations in total, with 56 columns . The data has 25 observations each, one per year, from 48 continental states except state ids 2,9 and 12 (which we will later identify as Alaska, District Of Columbia and Hawaii that are not part of continental US States). All variables are observed for all states and over all time periods, hence the panel is balanced. Important variables are:

**Panel Index**   
year:	1980 through 2004			
state:	numeric id of 48 continental states, ordered alphabetically, ranging from 1 to 51. 

**Dependent Variable**   
totfatrte:	total fatalities per 100,000 population by year by state. Values range from 6.2 to 53.32

**Speed Limit Variables**   
sl55:	1 if speed limit == 55 for the whole year. If the law was in effect only during part of the year, it is set to fractions of 12. This applies for all indicator variables.  
sl65:	1 if speed limit == 65			  
sl70:	1 if speed limit == 70			  
sl75:	1 if speed limit == 75			  
slnone:	1 if no speed limit  
sl70plus:	sl70 + sl75 + slnone	  

**Drinking Laws**    
minage:	minimum drinking age, ranges from 18 years to 21 years.  
zerotol:	1 if zero tolerance law was in effect, and 0 if not. If the law was in effect only during part of the year, it is set to fractions of 12.   
bac10:	1 if blood alcohol limit .10	in effect, and 0 if not. Fractions used to denote partial years, as above. 	  
bac08:	1 if blood alcohol limit .08	in effect, and 0 if not. Fractions used to denote partial years, as above. 	  
per se:	1 if administrative license revocation (per se law)	in effect, and 0 if not. Fractions used to denote partial years, as above. 	  

**Seatbelt Laws**    
sbprim:	1 if primary seatbelt law	was in effect, 0 otherswise. There are no fractions in this variable.
sbsecon:	1 if secondary seatbelt law	was in effect, 0 otherswise. There are no fractions in this variable.		
seatbelt:	0 if none, =1 if primary, =2 if secondary. There are no fractions in this variable.		

**Age iimit Laws**   
gdl:	1 if graduated drivers license law was in effect, and 0 if not. Fractions used to denote partial years, similar to speed limit.

**Demographic variables**  
statepop:	state population by year by state. Values range from 453,401 to 35,894,000			
vehicmiles:	vehicle miles traveled, billions. Values range from 3.7027 to 329.6			
unem:	unemployment rate, percent. Values range from 3.2 to 18				
perc14_24:	percent population aged 14 through 24. Values range from 11.7 to 20.3	

**Year Dummy**    
Dummy variables $d80$ - $d04$ indicating years

It will be useful to add more context around the state information, in addition to the state id. Since we know the id is alphabetical, we get the aphabetical list of US states with two letter abbreviated code, and match with the state variable in fatality data. 

```{r 1.EDA.get.states,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#get state name 
us.states = read.csv("usstates.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ".")
data.with.name <- merge(data, us.states, by=c("state","state"))
```

To start EDA, we perform univariate analyses of important variables fatality rate, unemployment, % of younger population, and vehiclemilespc to examine the distribution.
```{r univ,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE }
totfatrte.hist <- ggplot(driving.df, aes(x = totfatrte)) +   geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill="#0072B2", colour="black") +   xlab("totfatrte") +   ylab("counts")
unem.hist <- ggplot(driving.df, aes(x = unem)) +  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill="#0072B2", colour="black") +   xlab("unem") +   ylab("counts")
perc14_24.hist <- ggplot(driving.df, aes(x = perc14_24)) +  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill="#0072B2", colour="black") + xlab("perc14_24") + ylab("counts")
vehicmilespc.hist <- ggplot(driving.df, aes(x = vehicmilespc)) +  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill="#0072B2", colour="black") + xlab("vehicmilespc") + ylab("counts")
grid.arrange( totfatrte.hist, unem.hist, perc14_24.hist, vehicmilespc.hist, ncol = 2, nrow = 2, top="Univariate Analysis of key Variables")
```
The distribution looks approximately normal with some tail for $totfatrte$, $unem$, and $vehiclemilespc$. It looks normal with higher slope at the top and lower slope at the bottom for $perc14-24$. 

Next, we examine the bivaraite relationship between some of the important explanatory variables and fatality rate. 

```{r biv,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

driving.df.mutate <- driving.df %>%

grid.arrange( totfatrte.bac10.box, totfatrte.perse.box, totfatrte.sbprim.box, totfatrte.sl70plus.box, totfatrte.unem.scatter, totfatrte.perc14_24.scatter, totfatrte.vehicmilespc.scatter,
  ncol = 4, nrow = 2,
  top="Bivariate Analysis of key Variables")

```
We see that blood alcohol limit 10 have a muted effect while per se , primary seatbelt have reducing effect on the fatality rate. Also note the higher fatality rate on the states with speed limit 70 and above or none. We also see a slight positive correlation between fatality rate and variables $unem$, $perc14_24$ and $vehicmilespc$.

Then, to examine both the overall fatality pattern and individual fixed effect of US States across time, we'll analyze the aggregate of traffic laws in US across time and across states. 

Below we analyze the fatality rate change by year and overall change by state . 
```{r 1 EDA.fat.by.year,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
#fatality change by year 
traffic.yearly.aggr <- data %>%   group_by(year) %>%  summarise_at(vars(totfatrte, nghtfatrte,wkndfatrte), funs(mean))

#fatality change by state 
traffic.state.perc.aggr <- data.with.name %>%
  group_by(shortname) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(totfatrte,nghtfatrte,wkndfatrte), funs(mean))

  #geom_abline(intercept, slope, linetype, color, size) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = FALSE) + geom_text(data = traffic.yearly.aggr, aes(x = year, y = totfatrte, label = round(totfatrte,1)), size = 3,angle = 90, position = position_stack(vjust = .5)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none")

state.plot <- ggplot(traffic.state.perc.aggr, aes(shortname, totfatrte)) +

  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none") + geom_text(data = traffic.state.perc.aggr, aes(x = shortname, y = totfatrte, label = round(totfatrte,1)), size = 3,angle = 90, position = position_stack(vjust = .5))

conditional_plot = function(data, plotvar, condvar, title) {
  g <- ggplot(data, aes(as.factor(condvar), plotvar, color = as.factor(condvar))) 
  g + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + ggtitle(title) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 6, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none") 
}

# yIndex by year (Heterogeineity across year)
cplot.1 <- conditional_plot(data.with.name, data.with.name$totfatrte, data.with.name$year, "Totalfatrte by year")

# yIndex by country (Heterogeineity across countries)
cplot.2 <- conditional_plot(data.with.name, data.with.name$totfatrte, data.with.name$name, "Totalfatrte by State")

cplot.1 <- data.with.name %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year), y = totfatrte,color = as.factor(year))) +  
  geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Totalfatrte by Year") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, size = 6, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none") + labs (x = "")

cplot.2 <- data.with.name %>%

grid.arrange(year.plot, state.plot, nrow = 2,  ncol = 1);grid.arrange(cplot.1, cplot.2, nrow = 2,  ncol = 1)

```
We can see that the fatality rate is largely decreasing from 1980 to 2004. The fatality rates range from ~9 to ~34. Wyoming, New Mexico, Mississippi, Montana, and South Carolina are the states with highest fatality rates while New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island are the states with lowest fatality rates. The pattern shows that the states with more rural roads have higher fatality rates - the geography and road conditions are thus important omitted variables in the dataset. In addition, the fataility split by cause (drunk driving, speeding) by state by year could be an important predictor. Another omitted variable could be the a measure of compliance to the traffic laws - speed limit, seat belt -  at the state level. 

The boxplots graph shows there is heterogeneity across states, but very little heterogenetiy across years.

Next we analyze how the fatality rates varied over the years, in individual states. 
```{r}
xyplot(totfatrte ~ year | shortname, data=data.with.name, as.table=T)
```
The above xyplot confirms that most of the States shows an overall decrease in the traffic fatality rate, except states like *Mississippi* . We can see that New Mexico(NM) and Wyoming(WY) has high variance in the data, with NM consistently reducing the traffic fatality rate over years. However, WY reduced the fatality rate from 80's to mid 90's and had a gradual increase after. One interesting point is that the traffic fatality rate is not dependent on the state area or population - the top 2 states with size and population, Texas and California, are not amoing the top states in traffic fatality rate.

Below, we explore how the traffic laws over the years across states, and whether they show a correlation with fatality rate. We first plot the fatality rate over years, and then plot the count of states that adopt the traffic laws, grouped by year and specific law after.  We hypothesize that the fatality rate is influenced the most by drinking and overspeeding and proceed to examine the applicable laws.

```{r eda.drink,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# summarize the number of states adopting specific traffic laws
data <- data %>%  mutate( sball = case_when(sbprim + sbsecon >= 0.5  ~ 1,TRUE ~ 0 ))
bac.df <- data %>% group_by(year) %>%
summarise(bac10 = sum(bac10), bac08 = sum(bac08), bac.all = sum(bac08 + bac10), perse = sum(perse), sbprim = sum(sbprim), sbsecon = sum(sbsecon), gdl = sum(gdl), sl70plus = sum(sl70plus), totfatrte = mean(totfatrte), sball=sum(sball)) 

bac.plot.f <- ggplot(bac.df, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=totfatrte, color='totfatrte'), size = 2, group = 1) + ylim(0,30)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(bac.df$year), max(bac.df$year), 1)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust=0.5)) + scale_color_manual(name = "Blood Alcohol Level", values = c( totfatrte="black")) + labs(title = "Changes in Fatality Rate Over Time", y = "Fatality Rate", x = "") + 
  annotate("text", x = 1987, y = 23, label = "Fatality Rate", size = 3, fontface = "bold") + 
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none")

bac.plot <- ggplot(bac.df, aes(x = year)) +
geom_line(aes(y = bac.all, color='bac.all'), size = 1.5, group = 1) +   geom_line(aes(y=perse, color='perse'), size = 1.5, group = 1) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=sball, color='sball'), size = 1.5, group = 1) + geom_line(aes(y=gdl, color='gdl'), size = 1.5, group = 1) +  geom_line(aes(y = sl70plus, color='sl70plus'), size = 1.5, group = 1) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(bac.df$year), max(bac.df$year), 1)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust=0.5),axis.title=element_text(size=10,face="bold")) + scale_color_manual(name = "Number of States adopting Traffic Laws By Year",
      values = c( bac.all="red", perse="blue", sball="green", gdl = "yellow", sl70plus = "cyan")) + labs(title = "Number of States adopting Traffic Laws By Year", y = "States with given Law",
x = "",size = 2) + 
  annotate("text", x = 1998, y = 5, label = "Graduate DL Law", size = 2) +  annotate("text", x = 1997, y = 35, label = "Per Se Law", size = 2) + 
  annotate("text", x = 1990, y = 35, label = "Seatbelt Law", size = 2) +  annotate("text", x = 1996, y = 20, label = "Speed Limit Over 70 or None", size = 2) + 
  annotate("text", x = 1989, y = 45, label = "Bac limit .1 or .08", size = 2) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none")

grid.arrange(bac.plot.f, bac.plot, nrow = 2,  ncol = 1)
```
Over the years, more states are adopting stricter alcohol limits. In 2004, over 45 states have a bac limit of 0.08 or 0.1, compared to ~10 in 1980. Similarly, ~40 states have adopted the Per Se law and Graduate DL law in 2004 compared to 0 states in 1980. We see a similar trend in seatbelt adoption as well. This is consistent with the decrease in fatality rates over time that observed before. Regarding speed limit, states had lower speed limit in 1980 - however, the speed limits were more relaxed in the later years as can be seen by the increase in the number of states with speed limit 70 or above, as seen in the above graph.

Lets proceed to examine the individual state behavior in the panel. First, we'll examine how the traffic fatality rates changed over years for the first 3 States from the top and bottom of the fatality rate. 

```{r 1 EDA3}
#fatality change by state 
traffic.state.aggr <- data.with.name %>%   group_by(shortname) %>%   summarise_at(vars(totfat, nghtfat,wkndfat), funs(sum))

top.3.fatalities <- traffic.state.perc.aggr %>%  filter(rank(desc(totfatrte))<=3) %>% arrange(desc(totfatrte))

bottom.3.fatalities <- traffic.state.perc.aggr %>% filter(rank((totfatrte))<=3) %>% arrange((totfatrte))

cbind(top.3.fatalities[,1:2],bottom.3.fatalities[,1:2])

data.top.filtered <- data.with.name %>% filter(shortname %in% c("WY"))
data.bottom.filtered <- data.with.name %>% filter(shortname %in% c("RI"))

data.merged <- union(data.top.filtered,data.bottom.filtered)
```

The top 3 are Wyoming, New Mexico and Mississippi. The bottom 3 are Rhode Island, New York and Massachussets. To put this in context, in 2004, in Wyoming, the probability of dying in a motor vehicle accident is nearly 5 times as high as in Rhode Island, the state with the lowest death rate. Below, we see the average fatality rate for each state across years.

```{r 1.EDA.panelplots,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
df.transformed <- data.merged %>%   mutate( perse = case_when(perse >= 0.5  ~ 1,TRUE ~ 0),bacat = case_when(bac10+bac08 >= 0.5  ~ 1,TRUE ~ 0), sball = case_when(sbprim + sbsecon >= 0.5  ~ 1,TRUE ~ 0 ),gdl = case_when(gdl >= 0.5  ~ 1,TRUE ~ 0 ))

g.1 <- ggplot(df.transformed, aes(as.factor(perse), totfatrte)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(perse))) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + ggtitle("Per Se Law and Fatality Rate Change for Top and Bottom States") + facet_wrap(~shortname) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none") 

g.2 <- ggplot(df.transformed, aes(as.factor(bacat), totfatrte)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(bacat))) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + ggtitle("Bac and Fatality Rate Change for Top and Bottom States") + facet_wrap(~shortname) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none") + labs(y="")

grid.arrange(g.1, g.2, nrow = 1,  ncol = 2) 

g.1 <- ggplot(df.transformed, aes(as.factor(sball), totfatrte)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(sball))) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + ggtitle("Fatality Rate Change for Top and Bottom States") + facet_wrap(~shortname) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none") 

g.2 <- ggplot(df.transformed, aes(as.factor(gdl), totfatrte)) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = factor(gdl))) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + ggtitle("Fatality Rate Change for Top and Bottom States") + facet_wrap(~shortname) + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)) + theme(legend.position = "none") + labs(y="")

grid.arrange(g.1, g.2, nrow = 1,  ncol = 2) 

df.80.04 <- data.with.name %>% filter(year %in% c('1980','2004')) %>% dplyr::select(year,shortname,totfatrte) 

ggplot(df.80.04, aes(shortname, totfatrte, group = year, colour = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=totfatrte), size = 2) + ggtitle("Growth Curve by Year") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, size = 6, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + labs(x="")
```

We can see that in the years WY has lower fatality rate in the years they adopted the Per Se, Bac, and Seatbelt laws. They are yet to adopt the gdl law (perhaps they should!). RI shows a similar pattern, eventhough the fatality rate was already low. 

Thus both the overall and state level EDA indicates that there is a reduction in fatality rate that is consistent with traffic laws adoption.

2. (15%) How is the our dependent variable of interest *totfatrte* defined? What is the average of this variable in each of the years in the time period covered in this dataset? Estimate a linear regression model of *totfatrte* on a set of dummy variables for the years 1981 through 2004. What does this model explain? Describe what you find in this model. Did driving become safer over this period? Please provide a detailed explanation.

*totfatrte* defines the total fatalities per 100,000 population.**<<TODO>>**


```{r}
yearlyavg <- aggregate(totfatrte~year, driving.df, mean)

# Printing the yearly average for total fatality rate
yearlyavg

# Plotting the yearly total fatality rate
ggplot(yearlyavg) + 
  geom_line(
    mapping = aes(x = year, y = totfatrte)
)
```



```{r}
lm.fit1 <- lm(totfatrte ~ d81+d82+d83+d84+d85+d86+d87+d88+d89+
                      d90+d91+d92+d93+d94+d95+d96+d97+d98+d99+
                      d00+d01+d02+d03+d04, data=driving.df)
summary(lm.fit1)
```



3. (15%) Expand your model in *Exercise 2* by adding variables *bac08, bac10, perse, sbprim, sbsecon, sl70plus, gdl, perc14_24, unem, vehicmilespc*, and perhaps *transformations of some or all of these variables*. Please explain carefully your rationale, which should be based on your EDA, behind any transformation you made. If no transformation is made, explain why transformation is not needed. How are the variables *bac8* and *bac10* defined? Interpret the coefficients on *bac8* and *bac10*. Do *per se laws* have a negative effect on the fatality rate? What about having a primary seat belt law? (Note that if a law was enacted sometime within a year the fraction of the year is recorded in place of the zero-one indicator.)


```{r}

lm.fit2 <- lm(totfatrte ~ d81+d82+d83+d84+d85+d86+d87+d88+d89+
                      d90+d91+d92+d93+d94+d95+d96+d97+d98+d99+
                      d00+d01+d02+d03+d04 + bac08 + bac10 + perse + sbprim + sbsecon + sl70plus + gdl +  perc14_24 + unem + vehicmilespc, data=driving.df)
summary(lm.fit2)

```
*bac10* is defined as the	blood alcohol limit of .10
*bac08* is defined as the	blood alcohol limit of .08

Both the variables *bac08* and *bac10*  have the negative coefficients of -2.498 and -1.418 respectively. They are statistically significant and it implies that they have a strong negative correlation to the total fatality rate.If we come up with a stricter law and decrease the blood alcohol limit to .10 then the fatalities rate decreases more.

Yes. *perse* variable has a statistically significant negative correlation with the total fatality rate. The coefficient value is -0.6201 which implies a small change in the rate.

**TODO** write up about primary seatbelt law



4. (15%) Reestimate the model from *Exercise 3* using a fixed effects (at the state level) model. How do the coefficients on *bac08, bac10, perse, and sbprim* compare with the pooled OLS estimates? Which set of estimates do you think is more reliable? What assumptions are needed in each of these models?  Are these assumptions reasonable in the current context?


```{r}

pnldata <- pdata.frame(driving.df, c("state", "year"))

model.fe <- plm(totfatrte ~ d81+d82+d83+d84+d85+d86+d87+d88+d89+
                      d90+d91+d92+d93+d94+d95+d96+d97+d98+d99+
                      d00+d01+d02+d03+d04 + bac08 + bac10 + perse + sbprim + sbsecon + sl70plus + gdl +  perc14_24 + unem + vehicmilespc, data=pnldata, model = "within")
summary(model.fe)

```


5. (10%) Would you perfer to use a random effects model instead of the fixed effects model you built in *Exercise 4*? Please explain.


```{r}

model.re <- plm(totfatrte ~ d81+d82+d83+d84+d85+d86+d87+d88+d89+
                      d90+d91+d92+d93+d94+d95+d96+d97+d98+d99+
                      d00+d01+d02+d03+d04 + bac08 + bac10 + perse + sbprim + sbsecon + sl70plus + gdl +  perc14_24 + unem + vehicmilespc, data=pnldata, model = "random")
summary(model.re)

```

```{r}
phtest(model.fe, model.re)
```
> Fixed effect model should be used



6. (10%) Suppose that *vehicmilespc*, the number of miles driven per capita, increases by $1,000$. Using the FE estimates, what is the estimated effect on *totfatrte*? Please interpret the estimate.


The coefficient for the $vehicmilespc$ variable is 0.00094005 using the FE estimates and it is highly statistically significant. In other words, There will be an increase of 0.94 fatalities per 100k for an increase of 1000 vehicle miles driven per capita.


7. (5%) If there is serial correlation or heteroskedasticity in the idiosyncratic errors of the model, what would be the consequences on the estimators and their standard errors?


There is no serial correlation in the idiosyncratic errors of our model as shown in the p-value below. However if there is Serial correlation then it  will not affect the unbiasedness or 
consistency of OLS estimators, but it does affect their efficiency. With positive serial correlation, the OLS estimates of the standard errors will be smaller than the true standard errors. This will lead to the conclusion that the parameter estimates are more precise than they really are. There will be a tendency to reject the null hypothesis when it should not be rejected.
